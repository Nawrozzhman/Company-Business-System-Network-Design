# Company-Business-System-Network-Design
The project aims to create a robust and efficient network infrastructure for a hypothetical company or business  using CISCO Packet Tracer. It focus on designing a scalable and secure network to support the organizationâ€™s day- to-day operations, data communication and resource sharing among employees and departments.  
A trading floor Support centre employs 600 staff. They have recently expanded and as a result, need to move to a new building. A building has been identified but has no network. This means that before they can make to move out, new network service needs to be designed and implemented in the new building. Existing Network comprises of the following elements: The new building is expected to have three floors with two departments in each for example;
First floor- (Sales and Marketing Department-120 users expected, Human Resource and Logistics Department-120 users expected).
Second floor- (Finance and Accounts Department-120 users expected, Administrator and Public Relations Department-120 users expected).
Third floor- (ICT-120 users expected, Server Room-12 devices expected).
Therefore, as a key member of the Networks Team, you have been tasked to design a network for the new building. At this stage, logical design is required, which shows the measures that you would put in place to ensure that the new network meets the current business need and is future-proofed
